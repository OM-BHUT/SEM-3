bootstrap notes 

padding : top left bottom right;


in css :-

font weight -> 50 gap

box shadow -> color horizontal(left or right) vertical (up or down) blur spread radius;

padding: <top> <right> <bottom> <left>;

overflow : x y;



I removed the justify-content-center align-items-stretch classes from the row to prevent unnecessary centering and stretching.
I added the d-flex flex-column h-100 classes to each card column to ensure they stretch vertically to fill the available space.
I added the flex-grow-1 class to each card to allow it to grow and fill the available space within its column
