// 54. Percy the peacock loves colorful parties. He has a stack of different feathers. He
// wears the bottom one to parties and puts it on top later. When he buys new
// feathers, he adds them on top. Can you write a program to pick his party
// feather?
//  For example: You have 10 queries, each separated by a space. If a query
// is "buy_<color-name>", he adds that colored feather on top. If it's
// "fetch", the program prints the bottom feather color and moves it to the
// top. His suitcase starts empty.
//  Input: 10
// obuy_red, buy_blue, buy_green, fetch, fetch, buy_yellow, fetch,
// fetch, fetch, fetch
